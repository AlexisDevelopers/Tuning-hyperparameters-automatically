This code shows how to perform hyperparameter tuning for a machine learning model using the Keras Tuner package in Python.

First we install the Keras Tuner package.

Next, the MNIST data set is loaded and the image labels are separated. The data is scaled and One-Hot Encoding the output. Sklearn's data splitting is then used to separate the data into training and test sets.

Next, a function is defined to build the model, which uses a variable number of convolutional and pooling layers, and finally a dense layer with a softmax activation function. The hyperparameters for this function are defined using the Keras Tuner package.

Next, a HyperParameters object is created and the build_model function is used to create a working Keras model and then generate a summary of the model.

Keras Tuner is configured to perform 10 random lookups for the hyperparameter combination that optimizes validation accuracy. Keras Tuner runs with the training data.

Once the most optimal combination of hyperparameters is found, the best model of all of them is accessed and used in the same way as before with Keras.

Finally, EarlyStopping is configured and the model is trained on the training data.

In conclusion, this code shows how to use Keras Tuner to find the best hyperparameters for a machine learning model and improve its accuracy. In addition, it shows how to use the best found model to predict new data.
